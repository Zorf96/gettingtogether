# gettingtogether
#a project by kat hardman, spring 2018


getting together is an interactive sculptural work interfacing a set of moving, capacativly sensinsing tentacles with an arm- mounted human interface.
Signals gathered from the capative sense of the tentacles are converted into sensations on the human interface, which in turn senses the wearer's reactions to the stimulus with GSR sensors
This signal feeds back to the tentacles, causing them to move in response

code for this process can be found in this repo, alongside curves for the laser cut pieces.
